    //                      returns the decomposition of matrices a,b,c into

    //[aout,bout,cout,t,k] = ctrbf(a, b, c, tol)
    //                       Uses the tolerance tol for returning the decomposition
    //Description
    //function ctrbf returns the Controllability staircase form of the system having a,b,c matrices
    //
    //The approach to find whether the system is controllable from its cotrollability matrix is not reliable
    //especially if the eigenvalues are sensitive to small perturbations. Therefore , for more robust approach
    //we use Controllability staircase form i.e. the staircase reduction of (A,B) pair.
    // Here rank is revealed directly from the submatrices in the staircase form.
    //
    //
    //The last output K is a vector of length n containing the number of controllable states 
    //The number of controllable states is SUM(K).
    //
    //
    //If the controllability matrix of (A, B) has rank r â‰¤ n, where n is the size of A, then there exists a similarity transformation such that
    //      _            _        _
    //      A = T*A*T' , B = T*B, C = C*T'
    //  where T is unitary, and the transformed system has a staircase form, in which the uncontrollable modes, if there are any, are in the upper left corner.
    // 
    //     _    _       _       _    _  _      _
    //     A = | Auc  0  |,     B = | 0  |   , C = [Cnc Cc]
    //         |_A21  Ac_|          |_Bc_| 
    //
    // where (Ac, Bc) is controllable, all eigenvalues of Auc are uncontrollable
    //  Cc*((sI - Ac)^(-1))*Bc = C*((sI - A)^(-1))*B.
    //[Aout,Bout,Cout,T,k] = ctrbf(A,B,C) decomposes the state-space system represented by A, B, and C into the controllability staircase form, Aout, Bout, and Cout, described above. 
    //                          T is the similarity transformation matrix and k is a vector of length n, where n is the order of the system represented by A. Each entry of k represents 
    //                          the number of controllable states factored out during each step of the transformation matrix calculation. The number of nonzero elements in k indicates 
    //                          how many iterations were necessary to calculate T, and sum(k) is the number of states in Ac, the controllable portion of Aout.
